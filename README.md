Consider a city in Florida named Gridville that has a grid layout of m × n cells. Associated with each cell (i,j) 
where i = 1,...,m and j = 1,...,n, Gridvile architectural board assigns a non-negative number p[i,j] indicating the 
largest possible number of floors allowed to build on that block. A developer company named AlgoTowers is interested
to find the largest possible area (shaped square or rectangle) of blocks within city limits that allows a building of
height at least h.
